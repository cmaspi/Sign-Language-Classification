# Sign-Language-Classification
Sign-Language-Classification directory contains a model that is trained on a dataset which has 20 different classes of hand signs. It's complexity is similar to MNIST Digit Recognition dataset.

In the Hand-Detection directory, there is code to classify the hand sign captured from webcam at 0.5 fps. (The low fps is merely there to allow the user to change the hand sign, it's just a design choice)


This project was submitted to hackathon conducted by Analyzer CAE pvt ltd.
